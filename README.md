Guessing Game
My first Python project - A Guessing Game

Hello and good day!

This is my first Python project, which is a guessing game. Here's how it works:

1. The game start by asking what number is being guessed. You enter the number between 1 - 10 for that,
2. If you win, the game will show the " YOU WON" message,
3. But if you lose, the game will show you how big or how small your guesses are,
4. After the game ended, you can chose whether you want to continue playing the game or not by choosing 'y' or 'n'.

That's it, thanks for checking out my code here, even if it's just a simple code
